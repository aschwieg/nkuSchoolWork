Project File Explanation
The project uses php to connect to the database (config.php) and 
then use the connection to get at the data. The controllers (customer.php, 
dealer.php, marketing.php, and production.php) are what represent the interfaces
required by the project. Each controller calls different views based on the user's input
which displays the data provided by the controller. SQL files are held in the sql directory.

Project usage (http://csweb.hh.nku.edu/csc301/schwiegera1/login.php)
To access one of the interfaces, simply select the type of user defined by the interface.
Once there, actions can be performed based on the user.
